# IambicKeyer
This is an iambic keyer based upon the Arduino UNO platform. It provides a means to generate audio sidetone for the purpose of implementing modulated FM that can be used on 2M repeaters.

The initial ideas came from an article "Iambic Keyer" in "Arduino For Ham Radio - A Radio Amateur's Guide to Open Source Electronics and Microcontroller Projects," Chapter 17, by Glen Popiel, KW5GP.
